# Programming Language 
  Programming Language is a set of commands and instructions that when given to computer produce machine understandable codes which processed by computer and produced desired outputs.


### List of Programming Languages

* JavaScript
* Python
* Java
* C++
* C
* C#
* Rust
* Objective C
* GO
* R
* Swift
* Dart
* Kotlin
* Ruby

# JS
js is used in WebDev , AppDev, ML and in Game Dev also.

### JS Frontend Frameworks/Lib : React, Angular, Vue etc.
### JS Backend Frameworks/Lib : Node, Express.

# IP Address

* IP(Internet Protocal) address - unique address that each device has that identifies that is used to identify that device on internet or local network.
* Internet protocol is the communications protocol that is address assigned to each device to connected to the network.
* An IP address is a unique address made up of string of numbers that identifies a device on the internet or local network.



  ### Types of IP

    There are two types of IP address :-

    1. Public IP address. 
    2. Private IP address

    There is two types of Public IP adress - 
    a. Static IP address
    b .Dynamic IP address


  ### Versions of IP

    There are two versions of IP address :-

    1. IP version 4 (IPv4)
    2. IP version 6 (IPv6)

  ### IPv4
  
    IPv4 is a version 4 of IP. It is a current version and the most commonly used IP address. It is a 32-bit address written in four numbers separated by 'dot', i.e., periods. This address is unique for each device.For example, 66.94.29.13
    The above example represents the IP address in which each group of numbers separated by periods is called an Octet. Each number in an octet is in the range from 0-255. This address can produce 4,294,967,296 possible unique addresses.
  
    #### IPv4 Classes
      Class A :  Range 0 - 127
      Class B :  Range 128 - 191
      Class C :  Range 192 - 223
      Class D :  Range 224 - 239
      Class E :  Range 240 - 255
  
  ### IPv6
    IPv4 produces 4 billion addresses, and the developers think that these addresses are enough, but they were wrong. IPv6 is the next generation of IP addresses. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the address size of IP addresses. The IPv4 is a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. IPv6 provides a large address space, and it contains a simple header as compared to IPv4.



# Port Number
  Port number related to to the network addressing. *Port Number, which helps to get connected with a particular server.

# Server
  A server is a hardware and software devices which bascially take a request from thhe client or user and give it back to response.


# Web server
Websites is a collection of web pages while web server is a software that respond to the request for the resources.

# HTTP 
  HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. HTTP was invented along side HTML to create the first interactive, text-based web browser. It is a protocol which allows us a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files. HTTP generally uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to communicate with servers.
  
  ### HTTP Verbs
  HTTP verb nothing but the set of requests methods to indicate the action to be performed for the given resource.

    * GET : to get data
    * POST : to send data
    * PUT : to update data
    * DELETE : to delete
    * OPTION and HEAD : for quering

   ### HTTP Headers
   HTTP also uses headers that can pass additional information between client and servers. 
   
      General Header - Information not related to the client, server or HTTP.
      Request Header - Preferred document formats and server parameter.
      Response Header - Information about the server sending the response.
    
   ### RESPONSE CODES
      Whenever clients make a request to the server, the server responds along with a HTTP status code. 
      This code can help us to identify if our request was successful or not. There are five categories of status code, which goes like :-

      0-100 - Informational responses
      200-299 - Success responses
      300-399 - Redirect responses
      400-499 - Client error responses
      500-599 - Server error responses
      
      
      
      
 # Database
  A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

  There is two types of datbase
    1. Relational Database (ex MyDSql, Sqlite3, PostgreSql etc.)
    2. Non-Relational Database (ex MongoDb)
